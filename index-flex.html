                                    The Škoda Octavia is a small family car (C-segment) produced by the Czech car manufacturer Škoda Auto 
                                    since the end of 1996. It shares its name with an earlier model produced between 1959 and 1971. 
                                    Four generations of the modern-era Octavia model have been introduced to date, delivered with 
                                    five-door liftback or five-door estate styles only. The car is front engined and both front- or 
                                    four-wheel drive are offered. Around five million units have been sold in its two decades of presence 
                                    on the market.The Octavia is Škoda's most popular model; about 40% of all newly manufactured Škoda 
                                    cars are Octavias.
